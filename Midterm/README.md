# Midterm
Take a project in Python you have worked on or one you have found online and substantially improve it.


For the midterm project, Iâ€™ve located an old copy of a calculator project I completed years ago in high school. The calculator supported basic arithmetic operations, but nothing else. I propose to expand the idea of the calculator to include tracking the history of previous calculations as well as being able to reuse the most recent result in the next calculation.
